Talagala 2024-06-23 Chapter 1 Introduction to R, Rstudio and Posit Cloud 1.1 Installing R and Rstudio Step 1: First download R freely from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) https://cran.r-project.org/. (At the moment of writing, R 4.4.1 is the latest version. Choose the most recent one.) Step 2: Then install R Studio’s IDE (stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user interface for R from [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Get the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop. RStudio allows you to run R in a more user-friendly environment. You need to install both R and Rstudio to use RStudio. If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, I highly recommend that you reinstall both and get as current as possible. Step 3: Then open Rstudio. 1.1.1 Posit Cloud In 2022, RStudio changed its corporate name to Posit with the aim of expanding its focus beyond R to include users of Python and Visual Studio Code. If you don’t want to download or install R and R Studio, you can use RStudio on Posit Cloud (https://posit.cloud/) for free. 1.2 RStudio layout The RStudio interface consists of four windows (see Figure 1 and 2). Bottom left: console window (also called command window). This is where you type and run all your R commands Top left: editor window (also called script window). Top right: workspace / history window. Bottom right: Files / plots / packages / help window. Now you are familiar with the layout. Let’s begin with R basics. 1.3 Installing an R Package The primary location for obtaining R packages is CRAN Packages can be installed with the install.packages() function in R To install a single package, pass the name of the package to the install.packages() function as the first argument The following the code installs the tidyverse package from CRAN install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) This command downloads the tidyverse package from CRAN and installs it on your computer Any packages on which this package depends will also be downloaded and installed Installing the tidyverse package could take several minutes. You only need to do this once. 1.4 Loading an R Packages Installing a package does not make it immediately available to you in R; you must load the package The library() function is used to load packages into R The following code is used to load the tidyverse package into R NOTE: Do not put the package name in quotes! library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ── ## ✔ dplyr 1.1.4 ✔ readr 2.1.5 ## ✔ forcats 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.5.1 ## ✔ ggplot2 3.5.1 ✔ tibble 3.2.1 ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.3 ✔ tidyr 1.3.1 ## ✔ purrr 1.0.2 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors Some packages produce messages when they are loaded (but some don’t) 1.5 Getting started with R An Introduction to R: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
